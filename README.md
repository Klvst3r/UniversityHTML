Development multiple applications with HTML5, CSS and JS

# HTML University. 
In this project, you will learn everything about HTML (Hypertext Marketing Language) to create incredible Web sites and applications.

We will develop multiple applications to put into practice all the concepts that we will study throughout the course.

You do not need to have any prior knowledge, as we will start from scratch.

For the creation of applications and Web sites it is necessary to know the technologies of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So the topics of this course can also be studied in the Web Development University course where the 3 HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies are taught.

However, if you want to learn only HTML you can purchase this course, and in the future we will add unique topics to this course, which will not be found in any other course. So for now, if you have already acquired the Web Development University course, it is NOT necessary for you to acquire this course.
