3. Configuring Permisions

In order to stablish a right workplace we need to change permisions because are too open in our case.

Permissions 0777 for '/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.
It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.

we change from 0777 to 0600

Keys need to be only readable by you:

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
If Keys need to be read-writable by you:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa


So we ply next.

---------------------------------
sudo chmod 600 /home/klvst3r/.ssh/id_ed25519
